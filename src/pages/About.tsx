          <p>Vinys was created by a group of therapeutic yoga experts, movement therapists, and rehabilitation specialists who kept running into the same problem: their clients — people managing chronic pain, recovering from surgery, living with fatigue, navigating hormonal shifts — had no digital tool they could safely recommend.</p>
          <p>Generic yoga apps weren't built for bodies with limitations. They were built for able-bodied beginners chasing fitness goals. Every 'beginner' class on every platform assumed a body that worked without pain, stiffness, or fear.</p>
          <p>So we built what didn't exist.</p>
          <p>Our team draws on decades of combined experience across Viniyoga, physical therapy, occupational therapy, trauma-informed movement, and chronic condition management. Every session structure, every condition filter, every progression decision inside Vinys was developed and reviewed against clinical therapeutic principles — not fitness trends.</p>
          <p>We believe yoga's greatest power isn't flexibility or strength. It's adaptability. The ability to meet a person exactly where they are, without judgment, without pushing, and without harm.</p>
          <p>That's what we built. That's what we stand for.</p>
